## Purpose

This project was made as an exercise on NextJS/React and MongoDB. It utilizes Moongose as an ODM to define schemas and manipulate data on a mongo instance, and the Mantine UI component library for front end components implementation on top of the NextJS Framework. It is a brief showcase of basic tech skills on the fullstack as well as feature suggestions for a sportive predictions game application.
The application is using mocked data, but the project includes working schemas, apis, and mongo client definitions, and it was deployed to Vercel, where you can test Mongo CRUD operations under the /mongodemo route.
